                    <h3>Changes I have made</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Since we were told that we could delete the cross-course API form the database when we started the project exam, I had to spend some time bringing the rainy days API back up on WordPress, I wish we were told that this assignment would include the cross-course project when the question was asked and that it would be wise to leave it up. This would have saved me some headache. 
                            I had to do some changes in my JavaScript and the API, since I forgot to download the API again from WordPress before deleting it, I just had my first draft saved, (a small blister there), but I got the API working!
                            </li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>I added more product images to that the thumbnails are different pictures. I Would like to make an image carousel here, but unfortunately, I did not have the time. </li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>Added a more descriptive alt text to the logo.</li>
                        <hr>
                        <li></li>

                    <h3>How I changed it</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Crated a new database and uploaded my WordPress files. I also made some changes to the API in WordPress.</li>

                        <hr>
                        <li>Added more product images on each product in WordPress and targeted each image in the script. </li>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <li>Changed the HTML of all pages.</li>
                        <hr>
                        <li></li>
                        <hr>

                    <h3>Why I made the changes</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I considered just changing the site back to having the hardcoded products being viewed and change this after the project exam were marked, since I had to expand my database coverage on my host to make this work now, but I then felt that some of the tasks would be lost and a lot of the features and code (all JavaScript) lacking. So, I upgraded my databases and got the API working again. 
                            I wasn’t aware that I could have subdomains before now, and since the exam wasn’t corrected yet I did not dare to change that database at this point. 
                            </li>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <li>So that the product specific page would look better and show more of the product rather that just the one picture four times. </li>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <li>To improve the user experience.</li>

                    <h3>How I changed it</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I added a border of 2px transparent on the main styling of the CTA.</li>
                        <hr>

                        <br>

                        <li>Added HTML and CSS.</li>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <li>I added an id and assigned CSS and position absolute to the buttons. I also had to add a Z-index on the top image of the section so that the image shows up in front. </li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>Shortened some alt-texts, Added title-attribute to “empty” labels. Added Aria-lables and title to icons. Etc. </li>

                    <h3>Why I made the changes</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>So that the other content on the page doesn’t move when the CTA-buttons are hovered over.</li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>So that the alt-text is more descriptive of the logo and its function. </li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>To make the text more complementary and descriptive, </li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>To make the site more responsive and user friendly.</li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>To make the site more user friendly and to have easier access on paged with more content.</li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>To make the page more symmetric and improve the design. </li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <li>To improve accessibility. I chose not to change the orange colour at this point, even though this shows up as low in contrast. I couldn’t find a way to solve the aria-hidden error but did what the Font Awesome documentation said was the right way to improve accessibility. </li>

                    <h3>How I changed it</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I had to move the menu and image out to <body> in the index.html file to get the menu to show over the rest of the content on the page. I changed the menu to position: sticky so that the menu always would be accessible to the user. I would change the welcome section to inhabit the "header" but for now I let I stand where it is in the "main" to avoid too many changes in the CSS at this point. </li>
                        <hr>
                        <li> Added an "Id" and styling in CSS.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>I made these changes to improve the design of the homepage. I feel that the image on top makes the page more inviting and pulls the design more together and so that the homepage will stand out from the rest of the pages. 
                            The image I had isn’t ideal for wide screens, but it shows the look and feel of the page that I’m going for. </li>
